<h1 class="puzz_title">The Last Word</h1>
<p class="flavor_text">Everyone's trying to have the last word! No wonder this chat's so dead.</p>
<hr>
<p>[4:40 AM] RSaunders: I’ve found that I can't decide whether my list of talents or my list of inventions is longer.</p>
<p>[1:40 PM] the sky and beyond: Spare the thought, then; my discovery has flown through space for thousands of years. You might see it again in four to five decades—without even using your trifling glasses, let alone a telescope.</p>
<p>[2:39 PM] shake it up: A fool like you can stay in space for all I care. My groundbreaking work was at the core of my field, solid despite waves of less talented men.</p>
<p>[10:46 PM] No Prize No Problem: Why are you split between misandry and egotism? I empathize with the former, but I must say... you seem a little out of your element.</p>
<p>[4:46 PM] Full Marks: All of you lived so long and still never had my brilliance. I wasn't nearly as hardy as any of you, but I still discovered more.</p>
<p>[4:23 AM] Wunderjahr: You're all insignificant relative to my brilliance. Not only was I patently a hard worker, but I shone an illuminating light on the surface of Science, filling it with energy anew.</p>
<p>[12:18 PM] wouldn't hurt a fly: I hope your arrogance doesn't run in the family, but that trait might be linked to ill health.</p>
<p>[11:33 PM] Piledriver: Gentlemen, please, there's no need to go nuclear on each other. It is critical to remember that we are all pioneers—and an architect of the age, in my case. Please cease your aggressive reactions.</p>
<p>[3:44 AM] IN: No, I must decline. Your contributions are infinitesimal compared to mine, considering my works could dictate your every move.</p>
<p>[1:32 PM] shock and awe: Couldn’t you have used some kinder alternative phrasing? I had far grander designs than you ever did, and with much greater frequency—and the current generation is finally appreciating me for it.</p>
